  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>Earlier this year I encountered a <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2048299,00.html">Time magazine article</a> discussing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil">Raymond Kurzweil’s </a>vision of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">Singularity</a>. These three links should provide you with a basic idea of the futuristic concept, but for my readers who may, very understandably, be experiencing summer passivity, I will give a brief summary.</p>

<p>The term “technological singularity” refers to a theoretical future time in which technology and computing intelligence surpasses that of the human brain. It is the critical point at which the synthetic machine possesses an intelligence and consciousness greater than the biological entity that gave birth to it. This idea is by no means original; you can see examples in most every sci-fi novel and film. What interests me, however, is Kurzweil’s vision of how this technological singularity will impact daily human life. His theory implicates not just those interested in far-fetched science and technology, but every single human being.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.google.com/url?source=imglanding&amp;ct=img&amp;q=http://deathreferencedesk.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/ieee-spectrum-technological-singularity-thumb.png&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YyUrTqyQGqXw0gG17YmOCw&amp;ved=0CAQQ8wc&amp;usg=AFQjCNHIaKpDviKPZGnL4JyE-SrAfAyGLg" alt="" /></p>

<p>In Kurzweil’s novel <em>The Singularity Is Near</em>, he puts forth the possibility of transplanting a human consciousness into a machine if scientists were able to mimic the exact architecture of an individual’s neurological system, a process called “reverse engineering.” In fact, scientists in Switzerland have already been trying to do so in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Brain_Project">Blue Brain Project.</a> By escaping the frail human body, we also escape all its limitations. This brings up the possibility of immortality (or at least longevity), escaping the physical boundaries afforded by the human body, and redefining reality. In turn, these possibilities raise many profound questions, many of which cannot easily be answered, or even easily approached.</p>

<p>How will immortality impact the human species? The awareness of death has permeated human life in both the macro and the micro aspects. All religions esteem death as an important event in one’s life. The concept of heaven, hell, and purgatory are based on death. Although my knowledge on religions is limited, I understand that part of what gives religion and spirituality its personal appeal is that they deal with inevitable death. You and I will die sometime in the future, and it is something out of our control. The very idea is more than daunting, it is destructive. Too many times have I heard the nihilist line, “Nothing matters because we’re all going to die in the end.” Religion lends meaning to life as well as death, often by asserting the existence of an eternal after life. On the micro scale, the awareness of death is evident in the typical age that people marry, from mid 20s to mid 30s. Furthermore, our education system begins educating kids at a fixed, young age. The structure of the “typical and proper life” synchronizes itself with the standard 90-100 year old life span of the modern day human. I could go on listing other examples of the societal “timeline,” but you get the idea.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.google.com/url?source=imglanding&amp;ct=img&amp;q=http://mamontoff.org/SCIENCE" alt="" /></p>

<p>Would immortality destroy these behavioral pillars of society? What reason is there to get married at that age if you will be living for however long you choose? What’s the big rush to get educated so early? Forgive me for not offering a definite opinion on these questions, I am still tackling them myself. At the same time that it lends me a sense of infinite freedom that accompanies the removal of a subconscious burden, I fear chaos. Without the pressure of time, would humans be as driven to progress? Or would we live in a constant state of dreamy torpor? How much does mortality drive us now? Would we, as a species, take advantage of longevity or would we exploit it as another reason to live complacent lives? I am not trying to offer some veiled assertion or criticism with these questions. I am genuinely curious of what you think.</p>

<p>Now the other question that bothers me is, would it be possible to 100% transfer a human consciousness? This puts my fundamental dilemma in the spotlight: do humans consist of simply atoms and molecules, or is there something more, something that surpasses the physical? If the answer is yes, we are indeed just biological machines, then Kurzweil’s consciousness transplant should succeed. But I’m curious for the day when this experiment is put to the test. Would it be the exact same individual once placed in the machine? Or would something be lost? Is there a such thing as a spirit, or a soul? And does it exist in the physical neurological system, or does it hold a metaphysical place of its own? My intuition is biased towards the latter.</p>

<p>Speaking of intuition, thinking about ideas like the Singularity, ideas that force oneself to consider disagreeable situations and compel one to question your deepest core beliefs, is very uncomfortable for me. But recently I’ve been trying out a new attitude towards thinking, “<em>Face new ideas with an open mind, but not necessarily an open heart</em>.” The mind and intuition are interconnected, but perhaps it would be beneficial to compartmentalize the two. In this manner, one can head into unknown territory and entertain ideas of all kinds, unburdened and unbiased by personal prejudice. However, the intuition makes sure he does not lose himself in ridiculous abstractions, reminding him of his inviolate agency in choosing what to think and believe. You can imagine this attitude as purposefully wandering into the unknown while bound by a safety rope that leads back to home. It’s been interesting so far and I wonder where it will lead me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>Among other things, Plato discusses what he believes to be the ideal form of government in Book VII of his <em>Republic</em>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Observe, Glaucon, that there will be no injustice in compelling our philosophers to have a care and providence of others; we shall explain to them that in other States, men of their class are not obliged to share in the toils of politics: and this is reasonable, for they grow up at their own sweet will, and the government would rather not have them. Being self-taught, they cannot be expected to show any gratitude for a culture which they have never received. But we have brought you into the world to be rulers of the hive, kings of yourselves and of the other citizens, and have educated you far better and more perfectly than they have been educated, and you are better able to share in the double duty. Wherefore each of you, when his turn comes, must go down to the general underground abode, and get the habit of seeing in the dark. When you have acquired the habit, you will see ten thousand times better than the inhabitants of the den, and you will know what the several images are, and what they represent, because you have seen the beautiful and just and good in their truth. And thus our State which is also yours will be a reality, and not a dream only, and will be administered in a spirit unlike that of other States, in which men fight with one another about shadows only and are distracted in the struggle for power, which in their eyes is a great good. Whereas the truth is that the State in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always the best and most quietly governed, and the State in which they are most eager, the worst.</p>

<p>Yes, my friend, I said; and there lies the point. You must contrive for your future rulers another and a better life than that of a ruler, and then you may have a well-ordered State; for only in the State which offers this, will they rule who are truly rich, not in silver and gold, but in virtue and wisdom, which are the true blessings of life. Whereas if they go to the administration of public affairs, poor and hungering after the’ own private advantage, thinking that hence they are to snatch the chief good, order there can never be; for they will be fighting about office, and the civil and domestic broils which thus arise will be the ruin of the rulers themselves and of the whole State.</p></blockquote>

<p>Plato discusses an aristocracy of philosophers, those who are most educated and who possess an intrinsic motivation for creating a perfect society. It is unthinkable that such philosophers, such sublime men, could fall victim to crass personal motives. These are semi-divine beings who “ take their turn at the toils of State, [despite that] they are allowed to spend the greater part of their time with one another in the heavenly light.” Most interestingly, he implies a natural categorization of humans, the philosopher and the non philosopher. Most disturbingly, he suggests the superiority of philosophers to non-philosophers.</p>

<p>From my meager seventeen years of experience, I have never encountered anyone as “perfect” as described by Plato. I do not admire individuals because they conform to some objectively defined ideal of perfection. I do not admire them because I think they possess some singular elusive truth of life that I desire to reach. Rather, I look for the metaphysical ability to see beyond perfection, and I admire the strength of the individual’s deepest convictions and their courage to express those. True, I tend to look up to people whose beliefs are similar to mine. But I hold sincere respect for all who dare to openly voice themselves, even if they may believe in ideas contrary to mine.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.google.com/url?source=imgres&amp;ct=img&amp;q=http://www.ezeedictionary.com/imagedict/i/imbalance.jpg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hyQaTrmgI8fKgQei4OAb&amp;ved=0CAQQ8wc&amp;usg=AFQjCNFEf5vsgMEZv0YqDGcjrnHZ3X5bcA" alt="" /></p>

<p>Despite valuing individuality as a supreme virtue, I can’t help but cynically doubt the notion of the universal endowment of equal talents and skills. Don’t interpret this an authoritarian justification of slavery. The best I can express it is a sad feeling of indignation towards a natural inequality in the indifferent universe. I am always suspicious of statements that claim the superiority of one human being to another, and I very rarely take such statements seriously. At the same time however, I cannot trust that all humans were born equal in terms of logical reasoning, physical fitness, artistic talent, creativity, attractiveness, and all other human qualities. To this you might respond that different people have different talents, and that it’s impossible to compare the overall facility of a person. But this seems too idealistic, too utopian of an idea. What if some people are just born more disposed to coexisting on the Earth, more quick to find meaning? What if some people are born simply lacking certain skills essential to finding meaning? If there was some way to objectively quantify individuals’ talents and skills, I fear that the numbers would come out differently. It’s dangerous enough for me to toy with this idea, so I’m not going to attempt to offer what I believe to be examples of such “essential skills.”  The factor of luck and fate is present in all lives. Some people are simply luckier than others, in terms of birth and life events.</p>

<p><a href="http://harveyxia.wordpress.com/2011/06/25/transliminism-part-ii/"><img src="http://harveyxia.wordpress.com/2011/06/25/transliminism-part-ii/" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Imagine a world where all our biological needs are fully accounted for by a super machine. This machine, through a miracle of technology, is able to infinitely produce food, clothing, medicine, education, enough for every single person on the planet. The factor of “nurture” is thus removed from the equation, and all that’s left is “nature.” Would everybody be equally productive (in any sense of the word, such as creating art, performing necessary jobs, finding meaning)? Or would we see a disparity in natural abilities? Referring back to my <a href="http://harveyxia.wordpress.com/2011/06/25/transliminism-part-ii/">Transliminism post</a>, what if some people cannot experience the fourth stage of transcendence, be it by an unfortunate fate or by an unfortunate nature? The two factors of “nature” and “fate” have profound influence on the meaning of people’s lives, yet they are unchangeable.</p>

<p>Perhaps humans’ strength lies in our ability to change conditions predetermined by the universe. In addition to combating societal mores of our own doing, maybe another responsibility lies in fighting the indifference of the universe, caring for one another with no further justification than the fact that we are all of the same species struggling to live in this strange world. We all possess individual skills, and the question is how to discover, cultivate, and apply these skills to the world. There are 6.9 billion people, growing exponentially, and the more we even out the imbalance of fortune in all people, the more we approach a truly empathetic, meaningful society.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.google.com/url?source=imgres&amp;ct=img&amp;q=http://brightmorningstar.blog.com/files/2010/07/ManInUniverse.jpg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_yYaTtPSGI3VgAfvup0k&amp;ved=0CAQQ8wc&amp;usg=AFQjCNHEp0FnTvnFs8OPFlUJe6cdCbrz-w" alt="" /></p>

<p>Maybe, unlike Plato’s aristocracy of philosophers ruling commoners, we can reach a world of philosophers assisting philosophers. I don’t like the traditional definition of “philosopher” as someone who concerns themselves with obscure dialectics and who live by logic. Rather, I see a philosopher as any other human being, struggling to swim against the current of the universe, swimming with the relentless faith that there exists a shore on the other side and aiding those with weaker limbs, hand in hand. A philosopher embodies humanity, in all its various forms. The most stunning, I think, is that distinctly human ability to see potential for a more beautiful future, and to pursue that vision with infinite willpower.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>The question of reality is a popular one. From the ancient Greek philosophers to modern films (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix">The Matrix</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception">Inception</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutter_Island_(film)">Shutter Island</a>), the task of defining reality manifests itself in a variety of ways. Even before we can ask, “What is reality,” we must interrogate our ability to even answer such a question.</p>

<p>Humans’ connection to the physical world relies on our sense of taste, touch, sight, hearing, and smell. However, we do not experience the physical universe in a direct way, there exists a middle man: our brain. Collectively, our sense organs are referred to as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system">PNS</a>, and gathered information is received and processed by our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system">CNS</a>. Therefore, everything we experience on a daily basis, every physical sensation, are merely our brain’s interpretation of the real world. You are not seeing text on a computer screen right now, you are seeing the brain-processed product of whatever this is. So logically, I think it’s safe to say that the human perception of reality is heavily, if not completely, mediated by our nervous systems.</p>

<p>But then how can we trust our perception of reality? How can we rely on this to be the true, objective reality when we perceive it through our subjective brains? I’m sure you’ve encountered the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_philosophy#Qualia">perception-of-color dilemma</a> as an example. True, there does exist a relativity between objects that remains universal. But this relativity itself may differ the same way that math fractions can be proportioned in different magnitudes.</p>

<p>But honestly, the above issues are too dialectic and pointless for my taste. Instead, I take the idea of a subjectively defined reality, and apply it to our perception of the metaphysical, meaning our ideas, emotions, and attitudes towards different situations of life. In <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Enquiry_Concerning_Human_Understanding">An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding</a></em> David Hume writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>Nothing is more free than the imagination of man; and though it cannot exceed that original stock of ideas furnished by the internal and external senses, it has unlimited power of mixing, compounding, separating, and dividing these ideas, in all the varieties of fiction and vision.</p></blockquote>

<p>Imagination is what allows us to connect the dots any which way we like. Our minds endow us with the incredible power to dream, envision, and create things without the restriction of the laws of physics (or any laws for that matter). But not only that, if reality is truly a fluid, subjective thing, then our imaginations function as the bridge between ourselves and the outside world. Our imagination takes our sense perceptions and molds them into something that we can relate to on the deepest, most instinctive level. Like a translator, we rely on it to understand the universe.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.google.com/url?source=imgres&amp;ct=img&amp;q=http://www.neptune3d.net/images/treehill.jpg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lFUWTrWbG8LZgAfekN33Dw&amp;ved=0CAQQ8wc4Hg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFMBnhLAPrwaXLnh26cxo6vrC2H_g" alt="" /></p>

<p>It’s a sad notion that imaginative potential tends to fade as we age. As we travel along the conveyor belt in the educational factory, creativity and artistry more often than not get replaced by mechanical facts and skills. I know this is quite an arrogant statement to make, especially for a kid who’s only a rising high school senior. But I’m simply voicing what my human instinct tells me. Don’t take my word for it, take it from Ken Robinson and his compelling TED speech.</p>

<p>[ted id=66]</p>

<p>I constantly remind myself that for pragmatism’s sake, I must endure. But I fear that in the not too distant future, my imagination may disappear completely, relegating me to a life of monotony, working at a corporate job dressed in a cookie-cutter suit. The film <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Road_(film)">Revolutionary Road</a> explores this danger in a moving way. Pragmatically speaking, imagination or “the vision” as Apple likes to call it, would catalyze American industrial and scientific innovation, which would do wonders for the job market and economy. Metaphysically speaking, an active imagination would help us discover meaning. The world around us can suddenly become more lively, as if the black and white coloring book had been completed. Experiences become richer and more fulfilling. Perhaps it’s not too far-fetched to believe that dreams can be actualized. If everyone did so, consider how much more exciting the world would be. Colors never before seen, sounds never before heard, ideas never before thought. And suddenly, on one fine morning, monotony becomes only a word, a remnant of bleaker times.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.google.com/url?source=imgres&amp;ct=img&amp;q=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-14x67Be9e6E/TZnXqQdgcNI/AAAAAAAAAH8/EwIdAlylWFI/s1600/imagination2.jpg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rFQWTpLSMo7QgAeclMn3Dw&amp;ved=0CAQQ8wc&amp;usg=AFQjCNET0RviR5Dmg5j0bRP9SMWWul9_Ww" alt="" /></p>

<p>Perhaps that’s why older kids and adults alike look upon young children with fascination. They remind us of the days when our imagination danced rampant in a reality of pure possibility. In an instant, we could transport ourselves to the age of the dinosaurs. In another, we were superheroes saving the world. Such power of mind we once possessed. Such humanity.</p>

<p>Please watch this classic scene from the Matrix before you read this post.</p>

<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjgE8Lw5YaQ&amp;feature=related]</p>

<p>For those of you who have not seen the Matrix Trilogy, I highly recommend it. Not only does it offer the adrenaline rush of a special-effects thriller, but it’s rich in philosophical ideas. I love the symbolism of the blue pill versus red pill dilemma. It’s an elegant metaphor for an idea I’ve been contemplating this past school year.</p>

<p>This theory rests on the assumption that human experiences are all relative. Put simply, whatever satisfies me, may or may not satisfy another individual. I may find meaning in reading literature written by JD Salinger, whereas someone else may dismiss his works as plagued by a childish idealism. Specifically to Blue Pill Theory, different experiences satisfy different people.</p>

<p>Along with all the traditional, shallow academic stresses of this past junior year, came an even greater burden for me. I was plagued by a restless feeling that all my academic efforts were for nothing, for what is the intrinsic value in memorizing textbook chapters verbatim, and completing homework assignments as a robotic factory would manufacture product? I would ask myself, “Why am I doing this?,” only to be met with the dark, muted silence, echoing from a vacuum of worth. At the same time, I felt pretentious. Who am I to question the value of an education system that’s been in place for nearly a century? Of course it’s important to earn good grades and to work hard, one’s own future depends on it.</p>

<p>That of course, is the simple answer. It’s an answer that the blue pill disciples would give. Stepping back and looking at myself, I wondered why I was even bothered by these questions of purpose and meaning. What about all of those hard working students across the nation who are able to pass through school without stressing about its intrinsic worth? Why could I not simply dismiss my doubts as silly ideological musings? Why, in my own subjective reality, must I seek greater meaning, must I seek this perhaps nonexistent metaphysical realm?</p>

<p><img src="http://www.google.com/url?source=imgres&amp;ct=img&amp;q=http://www.unleavenedbread.co.za/downloads/image/images/GardenOfEden-large.jpg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=z9EHTs-xJ_S10AGpkvHnCw&amp;ved=0CAQQ8wc4IA&amp;usg=AFQjCNE0UJeSwirhi5r5GRHwkbF4VSZuNg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Perhaps this is unreasonable of me, but recently I’ve begun to envy those whom I consider to exist in the “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_of_Eden#Eden_as_paradise">Garden of Eden</a>.” I use the term to symbolize a life not plagued by doubts of worth and pursuits of meaning. Referring to my idea of Transliminism, these are the people who are able to carry out an amoeban existence, and who experience neither <a href="http://harveyxia.wordpress.com/2011/06/25/transliminism-part-ii/">awareness nor descent</a>. They can live in blissful ignorance, manifested in a variety of ways, but chiefly in their lacking an intuition that begs for metaphysical satisfaction. Perhaps they do not feel obligated to improve the world around them. The various social mores and environmental crises of the day do not disconcert them. Furthermore, the recreational activities of pop culture, such as binge drinking and status seeking, may be enough to satisfy their minds. Sacrificing time and effort, perhaps even dignity, to robotically manufacture high academic scores, might arouse no discomfort.</p>

<p>One could say that such individuals do not actually live in the Garden of Eden, but live in a horrible <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix#Plot">Matrix</a>. However, if Matrix-participants do not know of a greater reality, why does it matter? Even if it is a Matrix, to them it might truly a Garden of Eden. Reality may very well be a subjective thing. Humans, despite being the same species, may not all reach similar conclusions about the need to pursue metaphysical meaning.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.google.com/url?source=imgres&amp;ct=img&amp;q=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_WNcLmI1D03s/Swsfyzki-rI/AAAAAAAAC98/pVgVEpnIFjY/s1600/difficult.jpg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FtIHTtbeOMez0AGKqeG4Cw&amp;ved=0CAQQ8wc&amp;usg=AFQjCNFtKtekBwfNK7LSiKJ4qAdISRD6oA" alt="" /></p>

<p>These notions make me see the world in a different, much more cynical light. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Cody.D.OBrien">Cody O’Brien </a>put forth this video game allegory; some people are born into the world having to play the game of life on the “hard” difficulty, while others are born having to play the game on the “easy” mode. There probably exists a spectrum of difficulty, but the concept remains the same. Based on both nature and nurture, certain people are disposed to approach life with an optimism and bliss that others do not possess. Some people are more vulnerable to clinical depression, and others have experienced unfortunate tragedy. Biting into the forbidden fruit, in this case, is not a choice, but simply fate. The half-full versus half-empty is not a test of choice, but of circumstance.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.google.com/url?source=imgres&amp;ct=img&amp;q=http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lcx6tbESec1qddtdxo1_500.png&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=itEHTufFJsuz0AH8-sG2Cw&amp;ved=0CAQQ8wc&amp;usg=AFQjCNEJvhQHtZmeyIF62HtDftWlBw3JBA" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now, I call this “Blue Pill Theory” because of the theoretical blue pill that once taken, can revert one’s thinking back to a blissful, matrix-induced state. I admit this sounds a lot like using drugs or alcohol to escape one’s problems. The idea is similar, but the blue pill would be a total reversion. It would wipe the slate clean, leaving no trace of former angst. It would be like living another life. Ask yourself, would you take the blue pill? There are days where I honestly would take the blue pill. There are also days where I scoff at such a ridiculous choice.</p>

<p>I must say, my natural disposition recoils from believing in this dark theory of mine, because this Blue Pill Theory discredits the pursuit of meaning. If Blue Pill Theory were true, and certain people are naturally inclined to “easier” lives, that means my pursuit of “meaning,” whatever the heck that is, is a pathetic, natural response in pushing me to survive. If Blue Pill Theory were true, that would mean I simply got the short end of the stick, and now I’m forced to struggle in return for no reward. What is the difference between meaning I achieve, and meaning achieved by Eden members? Isn’t it all subjective meaning? Why is my meaning so much harder to earn?</p>

<p>But my intuition tells me that at the end of the road, I will be glad that I struggled so. Maybe humans do reach some universal conclusion about the purpose of life. Maybe the Garden of Eden is merely a euphemism for what is actually a Matrix. Or maybe my intuition is just leading me on to trust in a nonexistent metaphysical realm simply because, for survival’s sake, I must.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>In the philosophy of Transliminism, humans possess the potential to differentiate life from death by reaching a metaphysical realm. The stakes of achieving this differentiation are enormous, for it lends meaning to our existence. Otherwise, humans would essentially be amoebas, organisms whose existence are purely physical, an existence able to be boiled down to simple science.</p>

<p>In this post I shall elaborate on the journey to reaching a metaphysical realm. Keep in mind for this post, as well as all posts on this blog, that I am merely speculating based on my limited experiences and time alive. Take this for what you wish.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?source=imgres&amp;ct=img&amp;q=http://gorillaartfare.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/cognition_thinker25final1.jpg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XU0GTtycFOfk0QGSy4HJCw&amp;ved=0CAQQ8wc4IA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEpgWY28YOID2UYCv8_RoksZaf6Mg"><img src="http://www.google.com/url?source=imgres&amp;ct=img&amp;q=http://gorillaartfare.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/cognition_thinker25final1.jpg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XU0GTtycFOfk0QGSy4HJCw&amp;ved=0CAQQ8wc4IA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEpgWY28YOID2UYCv8_RoksZaf6Mg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><strong>1. Nonexistence</strong></p>

<p>****At this stage, the individual has not yet been born. Since he does not exist, his metaphysical level of function remains at the neutral level, or the “amoeba line.”</p>

<p><strong>2. Birth</strong></p>

<p>****The individual is born. Now possessing a consciousness, he is able to function metaphysically to some degree.</p>

<p><strong>3. Awareness and Descent</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://www.google.com/url?source=imgres&amp;ct=img&amp;q=http://gorillaartfare.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/cognition_thinker25final1.jpg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XU0GTtycFOfk0QGSy4HJCw&amp;ved=0CAQQ8wc4IA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEpgWY28YOID2UYCv8_RoksZaf6Mg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It is my belief that before anyone can discover meaning, they must first be disillusioned the the vacuum of meaning present in society and the monotony of everyday life. This relates to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism">existentialist </a>belief that life is inherently meaningless. The universe was not created to answer the struggles of man. Therefore, embarking on the journey for meaning poses a risk, that of relinquishing blissful ignorance and having the truth of a meaningless environment thrust upon oneself. The complacent ease of an amoeban lifestyle cannot be repossessed by natural choice. Like the concept of innocence, ignorance, when lost, is lost forever.</p>

<p>The journey for meaning is a gamble, risking one’s comfortable physical existence in hopes of achieving an infinitely more meaningful metaphysical existence. However, this gamble is more often imposed on individuals rather than chosen by self volition. Having experienced tragedy myself, I would say that this journey was imposed on me. I will elaborate on a later post, but I believe tragedy changes human perspective by suddenly shattering the idealistic notion of the just universe, governed by laws of principle and good. It’s as if the fairytale took an abrupt, twisted ending devoid of happiness. At this point of awareness, the individual undergoes a descent in metaphysical meaning, below the amoeba line. He feels despair and hopelessness, wondering how he should exist in such a universe so indisposed and apathetic to the individual’s sufferings. Perhaps this feeling is so strong that it even overpowers the empathy of a loving community. Although he may be more in touch with the metaphysical realm, it’s a negative experience that is fueled by misery. It is during this descent, that I believe many people sadly choose to end their lives rather than to continue existing. By ending their lives, they can escape the negative meaning and return to the neutral amoeba line of nonexistence.</p>

<p><strong>4. Transcendence</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://www.google.com/url?source=imgres&amp;ct=img&amp;q=http://www.openhandweb.org/files/openhand/images//Transcendence.jpg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7E0GTuG6K-r20gHC65DxCg&amp;ved=0CAQQ8wc&amp;usg=AFQjCNGroualk-bPAz_aLlMXiubJFr5d_Q" alt="" /></p>

<p>Some individuals take the more fortunate alternative, which is to not only endure the tragedy but to learn from it. Perhaps, by sparking their consciousness, tragedy has granted the individual a glimpse at his true identity and his relationship to the world around him. Perhaps he sensed a light at the end of the tunnel somewhere amidst the misery. He comes to accept the existentialist nature of the universe and faces the challenge of discovering and pursuing meaning as dictated by himself. He realizes that being in this ditch of meaning also generates the possibility of achieving an existence <em>more</em> meaningful than before, more meaningful than death and amoeban ignorance.</p>

<p>Before one experiences an increase of meaning, they must discover what is meaningful to themselves. The prerequisite to this is discovering one’s identity, which can be facilitated by exposure to a variety of human experiences and emotions. This may include traveling the four corners, or educating oneself through reading literature.</p>

<p><strong>5. Death</strong></p>

<p>In the pursuit of this subjective activity, this vessel of meaning, one’s life transcends the inherent meaninglessness of death. This is transliminism, the rise above the threshold. Not only does one perceive the difference between life and death, one possesses the knowledge to pick the fruit of human life. Human life presents the opportunity to attain meaning, and it is this very elevated level of metaphysical existence makes life worth living despite its transience.</p>

<p>The human is perhaps the only species aware of its own mortality. The notion of death has permeated nearly every facet of human civilization, from the success of religion to the idea of childhood education. For me, I see value in death because it drives humans to seek a metaphysical realm. It drives our race in seeking, perhaps a little too superstitiously, a way to differentiate between life and death rather than simply accepting that life is a series of chemical reactions, and death is the end of those reactions.</p>

<p>My intuition tells me that humans are not amoebas. Perhaps science is against this, but it is my hope that as our knowledge of the human brain grows deeper, that the argument will shift in favor of metaphysical meaning. Until then, I shall embrace my imagination as one of many <a href="http://taicarmen.wordpress.com/category/the-role-of-the-dreamer-the-falseness-of-civilization/">dreamers</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p><em>Let me preface this post by saying that this humble theory is the product of three individuals, Cody O’Brien, Garrett Lam, and I. What began as an exchange of whimsical ideas soon developed into a coherent stream of thought into which all of our previous fragments of ideas fit. It seemed strange that all three of us reached such a empathetic level of understanding, something that’s never happened to such a degree despite being friends for many years. It seemed even stranger to me that this theory encompassed all of my various thoughts over the years. Everything seemed to come together in this one theory that we call Transliminism, literally, to cross the threshold.</em></p>

<p>Let us begin by asking the question, “What is the value of human life?” Don’t confuse this with, “what is the purpose of human life?” I define value as a certain quality that not only characterizes but gives meaningful worth to something. To answer this question, compare a human to an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoeba_(genus)">amoeba</a>. I think, with my limited knowledge of biology, it is fair to say that amoeba’s have no consciousness since they lack the necessary organic machinery. The amoeba is not aware of its existence. It is simply an organic chemical reaction that will carry out until its death.</p>

<p><a href="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRXP-l4UIaJKFtJqLnp_eISUR8szRs9NxDZ0doC8Zp42o7x30R1wA&amp;t=1"><img src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRXP-l4UIaJKFtJqLnp_eISUR8szRs9NxDZ0doC8Zp42o7x30R1wA&amp;t=1" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Because the amoeba lacks a consciousness, which I believe is the only link to the metaphysical realm that we currently know of, it remains at the base level of metaphysical meaning. Whether dead or alive, existing or nonexistent, the amoeba will always remain at that basic threshold. What characterizes amoeban life is the presence of a biological reaction that controls everything it does.</p>

<p><img src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRXP-l4UIaJKFtJqLnp_eISUR8szRs9NxDZ0doC8Zp42o7x30R1wA&amp;t=1" alt="" /></p>

<p>Humans, on the other hand, do indeed possess a mind and a consciousness. We are able to transliminate, to cross the threshold. The value of human life lies in our ability to cognate and think, which I interpret as functioning in the metaphysical realm. Our emotions, intuitions, and sense of fulfillment are all connected to this metaphysical realm, a world beside the physical world we perceive around us. Humans are born into the physical world, transitioning from nonexistent to existent, at this basic threshold. The fundamental difference is that we have the ability to rise above the base level if we choose. Now, how is that accomplished?</p>

<p>Let me first establish some petty but necessary dialectics. I view <em>happiness</em> as different than <em>meaning</em>. Some say that happiness is the purpose of life, but I strongly disagree. I will address this argument in more detail in another blog post, but for now I will say this. Happiness is merely another human emotion, next to love, despair, and excitement. I think a lot of people also use the term happiness to denote a deep feeling of contentedness and satisfaction with their current existence. But I call this deeper, more metaphysical feeling <em>meaning</em>. I use “happiness” to describe more mundane, capricious experiences that offer short term satisfaction. I use “meaning” to describe profound, spiritual experiences that offer eternal satisfaction.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.google.com/url?source=imgres&amp;ct=img&amp;q=http://www.motley-focus.com/death.jpg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RMEETu63JIjX0QG13pCDCw&amp;ved=0CAQQ8wc&amp;usg=AFQjCNEvgDmCjxV4shVEli924PwS7KIptw" alt="" />Back to the main subject. Humans can rise above the basic level of metaphysical meaning simply by actively seeking meaning. But this is not a simple task. It requires a deep understanding of one’s individuality to know what is meaningful to oneself. Although the term is cliche, I think “finding yourself” is an essential task that will yield great fruits of meaning. Being 17 years old, I can only speculate that a wide variety of experiences would catalyze this process. This entails facing life with an open attitude and courage, not being afraid of experiencing new things and taking the plunge. In scientific terms, by exposing oneself to a variety of stimulus and observing the emotional results, one can begin to postulate who he is. After possessing a fair picture of who you are, you can begin to pursue those activities that you find meaningful. For many people, this means expressing love to others in ways such as donating to charities and volunteer work. For others, it means pursuing a certain passion, such as painting or running. Perhaps it may be a combination of things.</p>

<p>The beauty of human life lies in its opportunity to differentiate life from death by pursuing metaphysical meaning. This opportunity must not be neglected. The amoeban lifestyle must be cast away.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>What is human life? Is it merely an ongoing chemical reaction? Are we simply biological machines whose thoughts are the movement of sodium and potassium ions throughout our brain? Or is there something deeper to human life, something that the physical sciences cannot explain?</p>

<p>I lean towards the latter argument, that humans possess some quality, yet to be discovered and explained, that transcends the physical realm. I don’t believe human consciousness is totally governed by the biological processes of the brain. I am not religious, nor do I believe in the traditional idea of “god.” Rather, I consider myself a <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/metaphysical">metaphysical</a> spiritualist. I believe human consciousness possesses the ability to operate in a realm separate from the world we see around us. How do we classify thoughts? It is true that our brain gives rise to thoughts, but the thoughts <em>themselves </em>are not physical. I believe they exist in a separate sphere I call the “metaphysical” realm.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.google.com/url?source=imgres&amp;ct=img&amp;q=http://www.ufodigest.com/news/0509/images/human-consciousness.jpg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5pgDTuTEFOrt0gHfsYCPDg&amp;ved=0CAQQ8wc&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDu4bDA9ANDOvjdMzoUqp8y2XQCA" alt="" /></p>

<p>Having expounded my theory many times to a variety of people, I understand the myriad arguments against it. The strongest counter argument is that we simply have not proven the existence of a metaphysical realm, whereas millenia of scientific discoveries have served to illuminate the existence and the processes of the physical realm. Of course the physical realm must exist, it’s everything we see, hear, feel, smell, and taste around us. But this conclusion, I think, is too easy. Although we cannot connect with the metaphysical world in a tangible sense, we do get in contact with it through our minds.</p>

<p>Consider the thought experiment offered by my friend <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Garrett.Iam">Garrett Lam</a>. Imagine if scientists were able to recreate an individual’s nervous system, brain and all, exact down to each and every atom. That brain was then transferred to a body and allowed to function. Would the consciousnesses of the two brains be the same? If each brain received precisely the same stimuli, would they have the same thoughts and responses? The physical believers would say yes, the metaphysical would say no.</p>

<p>For some odd reason, I came up with this next thought experiment when I was very young, maybe around first or second grade. Imagine time was turned back to the time before an individual’s conception. His parents are married, but the mother is not yet pregnant. Time then proceeds normally, and the couple conceive the baby, which is eventually born. Would this baby be the same individual? Or would it be someone else, occupying the baby’s body? I have often wondered how it came to be me controlling this body, why I happened to be born into this particular life, with thousands of other babies, or vessels of existences, being produced daily.</p>

<p>Another pro-metaphysical argument lies in the existence of art. When examined by the lens of a scientific pragmatist, it seems odd that art should hold such a prominent place in all human civilizations. What is the value of art? It certainly does not help us survive. In fact, art diverts enormous amounts of manpower and time that could be applied to more useful activities, like growing crops and constructing shelter. Yet, from the earliest cave paintings to contemporary pieces of music, art has remained. I view it as a physical manifestation of humans’ metaphysical processes. Perhaps art serves as a way to maintain and protect the metaphysical side of humans, to keep us from turning into practical, biological robots.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.google.com/url?source=imgres&amp;ct=img&amp;q=http://www.donsmaps.com/images3/lascauxbulls.jpg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=v58DTrvjKobL0QGS8ciMDg&amp;ved=0CAQQ8wc&amp;usg=AFQjCNFJEnbFnuSI4qJw9__hlB90uk3wpQ" alt="" /></p>

<p>Despite this idea, I do not ignore the importance of the human body and its neurological functions. I am very interested in neuroscience as a way to perhaps reconcile the studies of science and philosophy. Science serves as the indispensable tool in lending credibility to human ideas, by revealing certain objective truths about the universe. Maybe one day science will prove the existence of such a metaphysical realm. Until then, we can only imagine.</p>
