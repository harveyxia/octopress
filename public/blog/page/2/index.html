		<h1><a href="/faces-of-zion">Faces of Zion</a></h1>
		<time>March 20, 2014</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>The road took me around a bend and revealed a ring of mountains. They towered over me not from a distance, but as if I was at their very feet. Sandy with streaks of iron red, their bare, flat peaks blotted out much of the sky. As I drove deeper into Zion, the mountain seemed to converge on the valley—two walls of stone closing in on either side.</p>

<p>Being walled in is how I felt hiking the Narrows, Zion’s slot canyon carved out by the Virgin River. There’s a section if it called “Wall Street.” The park ranger said, “You’ll know it when you see it.” It being March, the water was still cold from snowmelt. Jason and I wrapped ourselves up in dry suits that made us look like Star Trekkers, and headed into the opening of the mountain wall from which a river flowed. What began as a leisurely walk through an inch deep stream soon turned into a battle against a forceful current, forcing us to wade through chest deep water. The underlying rocks were smooth and covered with algae, perfect for stealing your balance and letting the river sweep you off your feet.</p>

<p>Two miles and two hours later, we stopped for a short break. I hadn’t noticed until then that the river had narrowed down to only around 20 feet wide. 300 feet of sheer vertical rock left only a sliver of visible sky. Sunlight could not reach down here. Everything was lit by a dim grey light reflected off stony surfaces.</p>

<p>The deeper we hiked, the more I seemed to see faces in the walls. Its smooth contours occasionally being accented by hard edges bore a remarkable resemblance to the human face, like the Easter Island heads. These colossal heads only revealed themselves when viewed upstream, their indifferent eyes directed into the canyon path as if looking ahead. When I turned to look back the faces were nowhere to be seen, hidden in the canyon grooves.</p>

		<h1><a href="/through-the-desert">Through the Desert</a></h1>
		<time>March 15, 2014</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Only when I drove to Zion did I understand the extent of Vegas’ geographical isolation — it really is in the middle of nowhere. Towering over all 360 degrees of the horizon, mountains constantly impose their presence over the valley. At night by plane, Vegas appears as a sea of shimmering orange light in the otherwise black nothingness; an oasis of civilization.</p>

<p>My roommate Jason and I went north on US-93, a highway that began with four lanes of traffic. Later, immediately outside of Vegas, it dwindled to a single lane of mostly cargo trucks. Several miles outside of the city, we were fully immersed in the Nevadan desert. Below the horizon extended a plane of dusty yellow sand dotted with stunted, hardy-looking plants. At the horizon, jagged mountains pierced upwards, sometimes with snowcapped tips. A cloudless sky arched from their peaks over the ground. All of the landscape’s colors appeared washed out as if faded by sunlight.</p>

<p>As someone who had only ever seen the eastern Appalachian scenery of New England, what most struck me about the desert was its expansiveness, how the eye could see all the way into the disappearing horizon. I felt dwarfed by the vastness of the open sky, the open desert, and the encircling mountains. Nothing was hidden behind forests or skyscrapers. All was transparent.</p>

<p>Jason and I had long since stopped talking. As the sun descended behind craggy silhouettes, the desert took on a calm glow. Textures gave way to shapes and lines. Looking into the distance, I was under the illusion that we were motionless while desert slowly flowed past, suspended in its boundlessness.</p>

		<h1><a href="/hack-your-workflow">Hack Your Workflow</a></h1>
		<time>February 07, 2014</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Since I started coding a year ago, I&#8217;ve learned many useful practices that have drastically increased my coding efficiency, both for CS psets and web/software development. This post is a catalog of best practices and hackerish tricks that I&#8217;ve picked up. It should be helpful especially to those who so far have only coded in an academic setting where none of this is discussed. These tools should help you spend less time fussing with your utilities, giving you more time to work on solving problems and building things.</p>

<p>(Note that this guide is primarily written for Mac users. I&#8217;m not sure if all apps/tools carry over to PC and Linux)</p>

<h2>Using the Terminal</h2>

<h3>Tip 1: <a href="http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/features/256_colors">Download iTerm2</a></h3>

<p>Don&#8217;t just use the built in Mac terminal. iTerms 2 a terminal emulator that has great features. For instance, it lets you open multiple tabs for multiple terminal sessions, and has 256 colors. Generally it looks and feels better than the default Mac terminal.</p>

<h3>Tip 2: Use zshell and personalize it</h3>

<p>I use zsh mainly for its powerful autocompletion. This helps with finding/selecting files and directories. Instead of just listing matched items like bash, Zsh allows you to tab through them and select the one you want, saving you a lot of typing. Zsh also expands the path for you if matches a single directory. Here I type <code>cd</code> and tab through:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.harveyxia.com/images/zsh_autocomplete.gif" alt="Zsh autocomplete" /></p>

<p>Another reason to use zsh is that you can customize its appearance. Here is my terminal:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.harveyxia.com/images/my_terminal.png" alt="My Terminal" /></p>

<p>You can change your prompt to include info like your working directory, the date, system diagnostics (CPU and RAM usage, etc), even the weather. People typically use <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a> to manage and install zsh packages. As for my zsh theme, I took it from my brother David. It&#8217;s included in his workflow <a href="https://github.com/davidxia/bootstrap_dotfiles">configuration script</a>.</p>

<h3>Tip 3: Get Good With Linux Commands.</h3>

<p>Here are the two resources I used to learn the basic commands, as well as how the system directory works: <a href="http://www.funtoo.org/Linux_Fundamentals,_Part_1">Linux Fundamentals</a>, <a href="http://www.linfo.org/index.html">Linux Information Project</a>. Having to look up commands such as <em>cd, ls, touch</em>, etc. can really slow you down. Once you memorize them, navigating folders with commands is as fast, if not faster, than doing through an operating system&#8217;s GUI.</p>

<p>Here are some useful unix commands:</p>

<p><code>cat</code>, <code>head</code>, and <code>tail</code> — displays the entire, beginning, or end of file. Use flag <code>-n x</code> to display first or last x lines</p>

<p><code>ls</code> — list files in current directory. <code>-l</code> gives additional information and <code>-a</code> shows hidden files denoted by period.</p>

<p><code>mv</code> — moves files, renames files or folders</p>

<p><code>mkdir</code> — create folder</p>

<p><code>rm</code> — deletes file</p>

<p><code>touch</code> — creates file</p>

<h3>Tip 4: Use tab completion.</h3>

<p>This one can really save you time. There&#8217;s no need to type out a long file or folder name if you can just do it in one keystroke. Furthermore, tab completion will pattern match and list all the items that start with the characters you&#8217;ve entered. This is an easy way to examine folder contents without an explicit <code>ls</code>.</p>

<h3>Tip 5: Use the up and down arrows.</h3>

<p>It pains me to see coders not use this. Scroll through your most recent commands using the up and down arrows.</p>

<h3>Tip 6: Use reverse search.</h3>

<p>Ctrl-R opens a program that, given a keyword, searches your command history for previous commands that contain that keyword. Repeatedly pressing Ctrl-R will cycle through them. This eliminates the need to retype or paste a long command that you can&#8217;t remember.</p>

<p>Also, the <code>history</code> command will list previously typed commands.</p>

<h3>Tip 7: Get Autojump</h3>

<p>This program, <a href="https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump">available here</a>, makes it incredibly easy to get around to the folders you need to. Autojump remembers folders you&#8217;ve CD&#8217;ed to, and ranks them based on frequency of use. When entering a keyword, it will match against that list and return the most frequently used folder. So, instead of typing <code>~/harvey/Desktop/School/.../CS223</code>, I can simply type <code>j 223</code>.</p>

<h2>Working Remotely</h2>

<p>Oftentimes we need to work using a remote server. This section should be especially helpful for Yale CS students accessing the Zoo. Instead of using fastX or other annoying file transfer programs you can access the Zoo server directly through your terminal.</p>

<h3>Tip 1: SSH</h3>

<p>The <code>ssh</code> command allows you to connect to a server. To connect to the zoo, you would type:</p>

<pre><code>ssh netID@node.zoo.cs.yale.edu
</code></pre>

<p>To save time, I recommend setting up an ssh config file located at <code>~/.ssh/config</code> and creating a shortcut name that automatically enters the correct user and address.</p>

<ol>
<li>cd to your <code>~/</code> directory and check if you have a .ssh folder (use <code>ls -a</code>)</li>
<li>If you don&#8217;t, simply create one using <code>mkdir .ssh</code></li>
<li>Enter the folder and create or edit a &#8220;config&#8221; file.</li>
<li><p>Enter the following:</p>

<pre><code> Host zoo
 HostName lion.zoo.cs.yale.edu
 User (your netID)
</code></pre></li>
</ol>


<p>To avoid having to enter a password, you can add your RSA public key to the authorized_keys folder of the zoo. All of that (including how to create a public/private RSA keypair) is <a href="http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html">detailed here</a>.</p>

<h3>Tip 2: SCP</h3>

<p>Say you&#8217;ve been working locally and you&#8217;re ready to test your script against Stan&#8217;s public test cases. You can transfer file(s) to and from the server using the <code>scp</code> command. Here is an example:</p>

<p><code>scp Binpack.c log.c makefile zoo:cs223/PSET2/</code></p>

<p>This command means, transfer the following files: Binpack.C, log.c, and makefile to the zoo server, specifically in the folder cs223/PSET2/.</p>

<p>To scp something from the server, simply place the remote file first, and the local directory second.</p>

<p><code>scp zoo:cs223/PSET2/Binpack.c .</code></p>

<h2>Use <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text</a> for coding</h2>

<p>Programmers all have different preferences for how they write code. Some like to use IDE&#8217;s, others like using text editors.</p>

<p>If you are using a text editor, don&#8217;t use emacs or notepad. You should be using an editor that at least has syntax-highlighting. This makes writing, reading, and debugging code much easier by outlining syntactic information visually.</p>

<p>Among text editors, the two most popular are Vim and Sublime Text. Vim is a command line program that relies on keystrokes to do things. It&#8217;s hard to get used to, but experience Vim users can edit text quickly, using a few number of keystrokes. There&#8217;s even a site called <a href="http://vimgolf.com/">Vimgolf</a>, where players are challenged to do things in the fewest keystrokes possible.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a big debate on whether to use Vim or Sublime Text. I think both are great and the right choice depends on the coder. Personally, I use Sublime Text because I&#8217;m more used to GUI style typing. I like being able to click somewhere to place my cursor, and not having to worry about switching being typing mode and command mode. Originally I was going to learn Vim, but I decided it wasn&#8217;t worth the first few weeks or months of slower coding.</p>

<p>There are so many awesome features built in to Sublime as well as in add-on packages. The following are the main settings and packages I use:</p>

<ol>
<li>line ruler at the 80 character mark</li>
<li>use 4 spaces for tabs (never use tabs for indents, they can sometimes cause compile errors)</li>
<li>highlight current line</li>
<li>Sublime Linter (lints my code for trivial syntactic errors)</li>
<li>Valign (lines up surrounding vertically based on syntax)</li>
</ol>


<p>Here are my user settings:</p>

<pre><code>{
"auto_complete_commit_on_tab": true,
"bold_folder_labels": true,
"caret_style": "phase",
"color_scheme": "Packages/User/Solarized (Dark) (SL).tmTheme",
"font_size": 13.0,
"highlight_line": true,
"highlight_modified_tabs": true,
"ignored_packages":
[
    "Vintage"
],
"line_padding_bottom": 1,
"line_padding_top": 1,
"rulers":
[
    80
],
"translate_tabs_to_spaces": true,
"word_wrap": true,
"wrap_width": 100
}
</code></pre>

<h2><a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">Solarized Colors</a></h2>

<p><img src="/images/solarized.png" alt="Solarized" /></p>

<p>At first I didn&#8217;t understand why it seemed like all the hackers I saw used this dark bluish color scheme. But then I tried it out. Something about the combination of colors make this color scheme incredibly pleasing to the eye. I&#8217;ve tried other color schemes to keep things interesting, but I always revert back to solarized. What&#8217;s nice is that since it&#8217;s so popular, there&#8217;s a solarized theme for almost everything out there.</p>

<p>Try it out, I bet you&#8217;ll like it.</p>

		<div class="content">
			<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to write a blog post for a few weeks now, but I couldn&#8217;t seem to follow through with it, for reasons that I&#8217;ll try my best to articulate. My hope is that trying to put these nebulous feelings into words will help me figure out just what it is that I&#8217;ve been feeling, it seems, more and more intensely since the beginning of college — this unsettling feeling that I&#8217;m losing some nameless quality of myself, the value of which I can intuitively sense but can&#8217;t articulate; an unsettling feeling that colors all of my experiences with the question <em>Does this matter?</em>, and an urgency to do and experience things that, beyond a doubt, have meaning. I realize that all of this sounds very existential. I would agree. But what I&#8217;m experiencing can&#8217;t simply be pigeonholed into the stereotypical &#8220;existential crisis.&#8221; From talking with friends and reading various essays, <sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> it seems that I&#8217;m not the only one struggling with the questions I&#8217;m about to raise. (In fact, what inspired me to write this in the first place was an anonymous email that a Yale student sent out commenting on Yale&#8217;s culture).</p>

<p>Late on a Friday night after an exhausting week, I was determined to write a blog post much like the one I&#8217;m attempting now. I wrote the following:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/calvinandhobbes_summer.gif"></p>

<blockquote><blockquote><p>I love this sentiment in <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em>, the idea that in certain moments, the best thing to do is to do nothing at all. Of course, here Calvin and Hobbes aren&#8217;t literally doing nothing at all; they&#8217;re sitting back and taking in the beautiful summer day. It makes me think of those perfect summer days where the tree you are sitting under casts a generous shade while the sun above sets the surrounding scenary in the most flattering light. Cool grass between your fingers and toes, gentle winds rustling the leaves. Everything feels, sounds, and looks perfect, invoking a feeling of complete carefree laziness. At its very best, it feels as if you&#8217;ve been transported to a place where your day-to-day worries are so distant that they cease to exist, where being lazy is the virtue.</p>

<p>In the quieter, less hectic moments of my college life, I find myself missing that feeling more and more. At college, my attention is constantly drawn outwards towards classes, activities, internships, and all of that other stuff that American college students are expected to be doing. In high school I suffered through the college application process with the hope that once I got to college, I could focus on learning and making friends and growing. But it doesn&#8217;t end. I guess this could be the beginning of what they call the &#8220;rat race.&#8221; There&#8217;s no more time to just be, in the most primitive sense of the word. There&#8217;s no time to sit in bed and read, to listen to music, or to go for a walk on a nice autumn day. Rather, there is time, but that free time is treated as a luxury too valuable for wasting on &#8220;doing nothing.&#8221;
For the college student, even his leisure time is&#8230;</p></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>I stopped midsentence, choosing instead to numb my mind by browsing Reddit and playing Dota. It wasn&#8217;t that I didn&#8217;t want to keep writing, but that it was a Friday night — one of the few times during the week that I get to kickback and give my brain a desperately needed rest after a long week of overclocking it on psets and readings. Leisure writing is, of course, a kind of break from the monotony of school and homework. It&#8217;s an escape from the restricted, logical, and analytical thinking that my classes require. It&#8217;s a way to step back from it all — to enter a quiet, isolated, and introspective mode. Writing takes me out of the groundlevel perspective of everyday life to an elevated viewpoint, one that is one step removed from it all, allowing me to think about myself and my life more honestly and deliberately.</p>

<p>Why couldn&#8217;t I get myself to write more than two paragraphs? Because reflective first-person writing is taxing on the mind in the same way that my classes are. While the reflective me was desperate to have itself heard, the rest of me was simply too tired, not willing to expend effort on anything. I could instead browse reddit while my mind slept. <em>After all,</em> the practical me thought, <em>it&#8217;s not like I would get any real reward from writing something just for the sake of writing it. Why expend effort on anything that has no return value?</em> But this is just the harmful sort of belief that I&#8217;ve let myself gradually and unconsciously adopt since I&#8217;ve come to Yale. The truth is, reflective self-expression takes an enormous amount of deliberate effort, and moreso, the capacity for insightful thinking diminishes with lack of use. Being constantly preoccupied with classes and extracurriculars and events, I gradually stopped journaling and writing and enjoying  lazy Sunday afternoons. There was always something &#8220;more productive&#8221; to do.</p>

<p>This is what I&#8217;ve slowly been realizing since college started, that Yale&#8217;s academic and social culture and my own lack of effort can turn me away from the creative, self-reflective aspect of me. The aspect I think of when I&#8217;m asked to describe myself. The part of me I consider as the source of who I am, as my persistent anchor of identity. But &#8220;lack of effort&#8221; doesn&#8217;t quite characterize it properly; it&#8217;s more like my lack of consciously being aware of these external distractions and giving myself more time to reflect. I think this is the root of that unsettling feeling that I&#8217;m losing something important of myself; my day to day college life leaves me so tired that I make excuses when I do have time to do some hard thinking by myself.</p>

<p>At college, it seems, everyone&#8217;s attention is drawn outward and away from themselves, and the culture glorifies this. You&#8217;re a rockstar if your calendar is filled to the brim with overlapping commitments, your extracurricular activites outnumber your classes, you&#8217;ve secured a prestigious  internship. And the ideal social life is very much analogous to this: you&#8217;re doing it right if your social nights consist of hopping from one party to the next and on to Toad&#8217;s, your romantic life (or, sex life, rather) consists of hooking up with various people, especially if others consider them desirable, and then waking up the next morning retelling the events of last night at brunch in the same humorously self-deprecating way that is really just a veil for your own pride that you are, in fact, living up the college life.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s that, without a second thought. Brunch ends and you automatically move on to the next set of tasks: completing those homework assignments. And the weeks repeat like this over and over. There&#8217;s not a moment to spare in between, no time to take a breath and step back from it all. Life is lived passively, reflexively, and robotically from one moment to the next. The mind loses itself in things that seem important but upon examination are really just inflated trivialities. And the effect of college, it seems, is to perpetuate this type of thinking in us, the type that distracts us from considering and pursuing what really matters.</p>

<p>Now, what really matters is of course different for all of us, but I do think that for everyone, what matters comes into focus only through hard and honest thought — thinking in the normative mode, looking for an answer in a domain where it isn&#8217;t clear whether an answer even exists, let alone what that answer is. It demands the courage to revolt against the values that are given to us and instead exercising one&#8217;s existentialist agency in defining value where there is none to begin with.</p>

<p>And here is where I find myself getting lost over and over again, feeling discouraged and wondering whether thinking this idealistic nonsense about &#8220;what matters&#8221; is even worth my precious time. Not to mention, this kind of introspection can be incredibly uncomfortable. Looking at oneself honestly and critically takes a very unique kind of courage that takes time to develop. Reevaluating what I really care about means putting at risk the very principles that I&#8217;ve lived by, and that means admitting the possibility that I&#8217;ve been mistaken. In short, reflecting on one&#8217;s values and decisions places oneself in a most vulnerable state. Lately I&#8217;ve been asking myself questions like, What does it mean for me to feel shame at getting a low grade despite trying my hardest? Why do I measure myself relative to the academic/professional success of my peers? How come I&#8217;ve known friend X for so long but we never talk about anything beyond what&#8217;s mundane and humorous?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m guessing that many college students never reach the point of uncomfortable self-questioning and unconsciously adopt the values that are most prevalent in their culture. At Yale, these tend to be material values; high grades, an impressive resume, lots of &#8220;friends&#8221;, and a hyperactive social life. After Yale, later in life, what&#8217;s important will be professional success, reputation, a six-digit salary, and the type of decadent lifestyle that would make any onlooker envious. We&#8217;ve all encountered this type of careerist attitude. And I&#8217;m not pretending that I&#8217;m totally immune to this attitude either. There does exist a very real necessity in securing financial stability. But the importance of material success is exaggerated. I usually only ever hear mention of the following career paths: becoming a doctor, lawyer, engineer, programmer, banker, and consultant. At dinner parties, when parents ask &#8220;What&#8217;s your major?&#8221;, they&#8217;re expecting to hear something like &#8220;econ&#8221; or &#8220;computer science&#8221; or &#8220;premed&#8221;. When I say &#8220;philosophy,&#8221; they give me a strange look and they don&#8217;t know what to say to me.</p>

<p>Usually the response I get to this thought is, &#8220;Who are you to judge those who value professional success? You don&#8217;t know their financial background. They could very well be trying to improve the quality of life for their family.&#8221; But even in extreme cases my point still holds: valuing material success does not require giving up one&#8217;s more fundamental values: friendship, family, identity, etc. Material success should only ever be considered as a means to a an end, and never as an end in itself. Spending four years at a place like Yale and then many more years in the job market makes it easy to forget that principle.</p>

<p>Another result of the lack of introspective thinking is that students become unable to talk their values. Granted, sharing one&#8217;s core values isn&#8217;t something that we feel comfortable doing with just anybody. It&#8217;s one thing to refrain from talking about one&#8217;s deepest beliefs with mere acquaintances;  but what about between friends who have known each other for years? What are two long-time friends to each other if they can&#8217;t share their thoughts about what they care about? I take it that these sterile, surface-level friendships persist when neither of the two friends take the risk of talking about non-trivial matters that require exposing one&#8217;s values and emotions. These conversations can be awkward and painful, but with a true friend, they shouldn&#8217;t be.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had the privilege of meeting some incredibly insightful and interesting students during my time here. But always, I find myself wishing that we could talk for longer and about things other than what we&#8217;re doing over the summer and how our classes are going. I find myself wishing that we were in a culture where it wasn&#8217;t socially unacceptable to bring up deeper, more personal, perhaps  more depressing issues when they&#8217;re weighing on either person&#8217;s mind and to converse honestly about them.</p>

<p>I realize that I can go on for paragraphs and paragraphs, iterating on this point indefinitely, each one digressing a little more from the next but all motivated by the same worries. It&#8217;s always a challenge for me to package thoughts on this subject into something coherent and elegant. If these questions were that easy to understand, these worries wouldn&#8217;t be eating away at me all the time.</p>

<p>The most salient point I hoped to articulate was this: creative, self-reflective, introspective thinking is immensely difficult, especially in an environment where my time and energy is nearly depleted by external responsibilities. It takes an additional strength in refusing to let one&#8217;s environment take away one&#8217;s capacity for this kind of thinking. Knowing how difficult it is at college, I need to spend more time away from all of the work and noise and distractions. I need to spend more time at the piano, more time reading, taking walks on beautiful fall days, talking to get to know someone, writing for myself; all of it as a way to step back from it all and see how far I&#8217;ve come and where I am headed.</p>

<p>And just as importantly, pursuing experiences to get to know myself and the world. Chasing those experiences that keep alive our innate sensibility to the beauty of the world, a sensibility that dulls with age and with time. Revolting against the incessant demands of practicality as a proud romantic, eyes directed toward the sublime. Because what is it all for if we can no longer dream?</p>

		<h1><a href="/my-visit-to-new-york">My Visit to New York</a></h1>
		<time>September 01, 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>A few weeks ago Caitlin and I visited New York as our last trip of the summer, a last reprieve before fall semester. We stayed at my older brother&#8217;s apartment in the Lower East Side, on Houston Street. It&#8217;s what you would expect of a New York apartment for a young professional: simple and functional decor, cramped, moderately run down, and windows overlooking dirty alleyways. The entrance to the apartment is a sketchy, non-descript metal door covered with graffiti. The first floor landing reeks of the trash from the neighboring Mexican restaurant. All this for a ridiculous rent.</p>

<p>From what I gathered, many post-college professionals like to live in neighborhoods like the Lower East Side for its nightlife. There must have been at least three or four bars every block. Weekday nights, and especially on weekends, the streets became a kalaidoscope of inebriated New Yorkers dressed in the latest hip clothing, shouting, laughing, and cursing in a hedonic riot.</p>

<p>As an underage college student from a Boston suburb, all of this was overwhelming. Being from Boston, what urban nightlife looks like isn&#8217;t completely unknown to me, but Boston, in my opinion, is a much tamer city than New York. Comparing it to New York, one can see why Boston has its nickname of &#8220;town&#8221;. Comparing New York to other cities, one can see why it frequently symbolizes a city of excess and hedonism.</p>

<p>But that was just the impression that that particular neighborhood gave me. New York&#8217;s neighborhoods are incredibly distinct, in a way that I had never experienced with Boston. We went to Chelsea, the Meatpacking District, Chinatown, Little Italy, Financial District, SoHo, Garment District, and the Upper East Side, among others. Each neighborhood has its own distinct features: its own appearance, ethnic influences, and commercial focuses. KTown has excellent, authentic Korean barbeque. The Financial District sports Wall Street and gigantic skyscrapers. The Meatpacking district smells like sewage.</p>

<p>Then there&#8217;s Central Park. I hadn&#8217;t realized until this trip just how big Central Park is. In the middle of the park there is a castle from the top of which you get an awesome view. On the east side near the Met there&#8217;s an ancient Egyptian obelisk that was given to New York as a gift from some Egyptian president. On the south side there is an area with chess boards carved into stone tables where people can challenge the local masters.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m having a hard time tying everything together and keeping myself from digressing. It&#8217;s hard for me to decide which of my experiences is essential, and which are merely tangential. But I think the truth about NYC is that there is no such experience that is only tangential. The Empire State Building and Times Square do not characterize New York to the slightest extent. I don&#8217;t claim to understand New York the same way a native New Yorker would, but from my few trips, I can see how New York&#8217;s distinct feel comes from its mosaic-like nature. Perhaps one of the only unifying New York experience is the experience of its lack of unity, its chaos and discord.</p>

<p>Another universal New York trait might be its noise. Walt Whitman wrote, &#8220;Silence? What can New York-noisy, roaring, rumbling, tumbling, bustling, story, turbulent New York-have to do with silence?&#8221; More bothersome than its light pollution is its sound pollution. There is a constant din of city sounds: loud cars, loud talking, loud contstruction.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m definitely still a Bostonian. I prefer its quieter and cleaner streets, its crooked non-grid layout, and the fact that you can see the Prudential Center from almost anywhere. I like the more manageable Boston Common with its ducks and swans, the Charles and its sailboats, the harbor beautiful in the sunset. But who knows, maybe I&#8217;ll get bored one day and decide I want to see what&#8217;s it&#8217;s like living in New York City.</p>
