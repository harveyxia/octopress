    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Beneath Las Vegas are miles of underground tunnels leading out of the city in all directions. “Underground tunnels” probably evokes images of hazardous, claustrophobic places, full of rusting pipes, electrical wires, and steam valves. But these tunnels are not part of the sewage or electrical system. They were meant solely to control floods. In the unlikely event of heavy rain, the city, being situated in a valley, would be flooded if not for these channels directing water away from the city into vast desert basins.</p>

<p>A few years ago Jason discovered an entrance to the channels by the desert next to his house. From a distance, it looked insignificant—cement walls topped by wire fences, like just another municipal structure. Walking up to it, I saw that the walls maintained a section dug out of the hill. On the wall facing into the center of Vegas was a square tunnel, as wide and tall as a single lane road. Jason handed me a flashlight and we headed in.</p>

<p>Except for the occasional manhole cover that led into the tunnels, they were bare of any structural features. These tunnels were simply long chambers of grey concrete. Occasional painted numbers, six digits long, marked the distance.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of walking, I glanced over my shoulder. A wall of pitch black met my eyes. Switching off the flashlight left us in total darkness. We were somewhere in the middle of this mile long tunnel.</p>

<p>The air was dry and cool. A slight draft constantly swept through. Combined with the utter darkness, the lack of sound became equally unsettling. Unused to total silence, my ears became jittery, expecting to hear something at each successive moment, but hearing nothing, like that feeling of unbearable suspense one gets immersed a well-crafted horror film. This hyper-expectant state made me hyper-sensitive. Occasionally, a car would run over a manhole cover, causing a sudden, jarring clunk to echo through the tunnel. My body jolted at each random sonic impulse of iron against iron, sustained and amplified down the concrete chamber.</p>

<p>After what felt like an hour of walking, we emerged from the other side into the sunlight. A wave of relieving sensory phenomena washed in. My eyes and ears once again bathed in the sights and sounds of the world. This section of the channel was exposed to the sky—clouds passed slowly overhead, airplanes droned, the highway roared softly in the distance. Caught in the wind, plastic bags whirled about with choreographic elegance. Empty, half crushed beer cans clanked along.</p>

<p>The floor was littered with trash: bottles, newspapers, plastic bags, ragged clothing, anything that the previous rain had carried with it. More and more frequently we saw signs of previous inhabitants. Dark smoke stains rising on the walls. Dirty mattresses. Bicycles hung up to avoid being washed away. I wondered if anyone lived in such an isolated place, and if we would encounter them. Probably not, I thought. This place felt like a ghost town.</p>

<p>The channel widened. The walls rose higher. I saw graffiti, most of it just a mess of neon lines layered on top each other. “HOLE” in large, ugly block letters, an arrow beside it pointing to a hole in the wall. Numerous hastily drawn penises drawn in two circles and a stretched out “U”. Beneath a red scrawl lay the image of a face painted in purple. Angular lines outlined its eyes, eyebrows, nose, and mouth in a way that implied the rest. The resulting gaze was so striking that we stopped to stare back it.</p>

<p>More and more frequently lateral tunnel openings appeared on either side. Other channels converged upon this one, Jason said. We were walking along one of the main channels that led to a wash. I looked down one these side tunnels, only ten feet wide and a few feet tall. Deep inside the tunnel obscured in the dark was a mattress, pots, a blue tarp, plastic water bottles, and other things I couldn’t identify. Part of me wondered if that lump on the mattress was a person.</p>

<p>Sometime later we encountered a man camped out in the channels. Hidden in the darkness, he spotted us first and whistled to get our attention. Instinctively I turned off the flashlight and stopped, my heart pounding, legs tensed up and ready to sprint back. Jason, a seasoned channel explorer, called out to the man, asking permission to pass. “Sure, go ahead,” the man said. I cautiously follow Jason forward as he approached him. Jason offered him food and water, but he declined. Besides being unshaven the middle aged man appeared in good condition. His clothes weren’t ragged. He had a mattress, pillow, and a cart full of food and water. I spotted a large knife lying on his bed within arms reach. Later, Jason explained that people down here need a way to defend themselves: “Being alone in this kind of place, you need to be prepared for anything.”</p>

<p>“We’re just passing through, I’m showing my friend around.”</p>

<p>The man nodded his head. “Keep reading the bible. The Revelation is coming.”</p>

<p>He went on to warn us about the apocalyptic dangers ahead. Instead of preaching to us the typical fire-and-brimstone voice of urgency, he spoke to us casually, nodding his head for emphasis. We asked him once again if he wanted food or water. He shook his head, insisting he was fine. As we walked on, I wondered if he really was fine. I wondered if he denied our help out of dignity, under some illusion that he was okay. I resisted the urge to glance back. Planes droned and the highway hummed in the background. All of it seemed far away in the distance.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Beneath Las Vegas are miles of tunnels leading out of the city in all directions. Made of cement and wide enough for cars, they are known as the <em>flood channels</em>. In the unlikely event of heavy rain, the city, being in a valley, would be flooded. The flood channels do exactly what their name suggests: they channel water from the city to the surrounding desert.</p>

<p>A few years ago Jason discovered an entrance to the channels by the desert next to his house. From a distance, it looked insignificant—cement walls surrounded by wire fences. It looked like just another municipal structure, for the sewage system maybe. Walking up to it, I saw that the walls outlined a section dug out of the hill. On the wall facing into the hill (and into Vegas proper) was a square tunnel, as wide and tall as a single lane road. Jason handed me a flashlight and we headed in.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of walking, I glanced over my shoulder. A wall of pitch blackness met my eyes. Switching off the flashlight left us in total darkness. We were somewhere near the middle of this mile long tunnel.</p>

<p>The floor was littered with trash: bottles, newspapers, plastic bags, ragged clothing, anything that the rain had carried with it. Occasionally we saw signs of previous inhabitants. Dark smoke stains rising to a point on the walls. Dirty mattresses. Bicycles hung up to avoid being washed away. Part of me wondered if that lump in the mattress was a person. I wondered if we would encounter anyone in such a dark and isolated place.</p>

<p>I could hear nothing but the sound of our own footsteps and breathing. Occasionally, a car would run over a manhole cover, causing a sudden, jarring clunk to echo throughout the tunnel. I quickened my pace, waiting to see the distant glint of the other end.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Las Vegas is Spanish for “the meadows.” It used to be a green valley in the middle of endless desert. Now it has become what is considered the “Entertainment Capital of the World,” notorious as a bastion of hedonism, a place adults go to have shameless fun. When others hear that Jason and I are going to Vegas for spring break, they tell us we’ll have an awesome time, half smiling half smirking.</p>

<p>Jason lives in the Vegas suburbs. He wanted to show me the side of Vegas that wasn’t just blinding lights and glittering casinos and flashy dancers. He and his three siblings grew up with the desert hills in their backyard. When he was younger they would go to the desert to shoot airsoft guns. In high school, the desert gave him a quiet place to hike and be surrounded by nature.</p>

<p>He took me to the top of the “ridge,” a tall and steep hill that seemed to be crumbling away. Besides some small cacti, the landscape was comprised of nothing but sand and rock. It was windy. I could see for miles around me. In the distance, perhaps hundreds of miles away, were the shapes of mountains, more and more faded as they receded.</p>

<p>From here, the city looked like arrangement of tiny blocks of different heights. It was small compared to the vastness of the entire valley—the last thing someone would think standing on the strip. As the sun set, lights began turning on until the entire city became a sea of orange. Together, the lights appeared to shimmer. The sky was cloudless. A full moon lit our way down the hill and back to the road.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The road took me around a bend and revealed a ring of mountains. They towered over me not from a distance, but as if I was at their very feet. Sandy with streaks of iron red, their bare, flat peaks blotted out much of the sky. As I drove deeper into Zion, the mountain seemed to converge on the valley—two walls of stone closing in on either side.</p>

<p>Being walled in is how I felt hiking the Narrows, Zion’s slot canyon carved out by the Virgin River. There’s a section if it called “Wall Street.” The park ranger said, “You’ll know it when you see it.” It being March, the water was still cold from snowmelt. Jason and I wrapped ourselves up in dry suits that made us look like Star Trekkers, and headed into the opening of the mountain wall from which a river flowed. What began as a leisurely walk through an inch deep stream soon turned into a battle against a forceful current, forcing us to wade through chest deep water. The underlying rocks were smooth and covered with algae, perfect for stealing your balance and letting the river sweep you off your feet.</p>

<p>Two miles and two hours later, we stopped for a short break. I hadn’t noticed until then that the river had narrowed down to only around 20 feet wide. 300 feet of sheer vertical rock left only a sliver of visible sky. Sunlight could not reach down here. Everything was lit by a dim grey light reflected off stony surfaces.</p>

<p>The deeper we hiked, the more I seemed to see faces in the walls. Its smooth contours occasionally being accented by hard edges bore a remarkable resemblance to the human face, like the Easter Island heads. These colossal heads only revealed themselves when viewed upstream, their indifferent eyes directed into the canyon path as if looking ahead. When I turned to look back the faces were nowhere to be seen, hidden in the canyon grooves.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Only when I drove to Zion did I understand the extent of Vegas’ geographical isolation — it really is in the middle of nowhere. Towering over all 360 degrees of the horizon, mountains constantly impose their presence over the valley. At night by plane, Vegas appears as a sea of shimmering orange light in the otherwise black nothingness; an oasis of civilization.</p>

<p>My roommate Jason and I went north on US-93, a highway that began with four lanes of traffic. Later, immediately outside of Vegas, it dwindled to a single lane of mostly cargo trucks. Several miles outside of the city, we were fully immersed in the Nevadan desert. Below the horizon extended a plane of dusty yellow sand dotted with stunted, hardy-looking plants. At the horizon, jagged mountains pierced upwards, sometimes with snowcapped tips. A cloudless sky arched from their peaks over the ground. All of the landscape’s colors appeared washed out as if faded by sunlight.</p>

<p>As someone who had only ever seen the eastern Appalachian scenery of New England, what most struck me about the desert was its expansiveness, how the eye could see all the way into the disappearing horizon. I felt dwarfed by the vastness of the open sky, the open desert, and the encircling mountains. Nothing was hidden behind forests or skyscrapers. All was transparent.</p>

<p>Jason and I had long since stopped talking. As the sun descended behind craggy silhouettes, the desert took on a calm glow. Textures gave way to shapes and lines. Looking into the distance, I was under the illusion that we were motionless while desert slowly flowed past, suspended in its boundlessness.</p>
