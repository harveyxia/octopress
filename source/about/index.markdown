I am currently an undergraduate at Yale University (SM ’16) planning to double major in Philosophy and Computer Science. My main interests in philosophy currently include ethics, the question of free will, the metaphysics of consciousness, Existentialist thought, and how to live a good life. I am a member of *Flourish*, an interdisciplinary academic journal that investigates questions of human happiness. I play the alto saxophone and perform around campus with various groups. In my own time I’m learning programming and web development.

When I’m not locked up in my room doing school work or wasting inordinate amounts of time on Reddit, I like going for walks in parks and woods; the more trees and the less cars the better. Dark coffees and good books keep me company at the local coffee shop on lazy Sunday afternoons. Among my many ambitions, I wish I could write like David Foster Wallace, think like a Philosopher, and play the piano like Bill Evans.
