<br>

I'm an undergraduate at Yale University (SM ’16) majoring in Philosophy and Computer Science. My main interests in philosophy include ethics, free will, and the metaphysics of consciousness. I'm also a jazz saxophonist who gigs around campus with Newspeak, a jazz quartet.

When I’m not locked up in my room doing school work or wasting inordinate amounts of time on Reddit, I like going for walks in parks and woods; the more trees and less noise the better. Dark coffees and good books keep me company at the local coffee shop on lazy Sunday afternoons. I spend a good portion of my spare time hacking away at personal programming projects and reading up on anything related to coding.

Among my many ambitions, I wish I could write like David Foster Wallace, think like a philosopher, play the piano like Bill Evans, and cook authentic Sichuan cuisine.

This blog journals the thoughts of a restless mind.
