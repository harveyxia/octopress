I an undergraduate at Yale University (SM ’16) majoring in Philosophy and Computer Science. My main interests in philosophy currently include ethics, free will, the metaphysics of consciousness, and the Good life. I am a member of *Flourish*, an interdisciplinary academic journal that investigates questions of human happiness. I play the sax and perform around campus with various groups. I spend my spare time learning programming and web development.

When I’m not locked up in my room doing school work or wasting inordinate amounts of time on Reddit, I like going for walks in parks and woods; the more trees and the less noise the better. Dark coffees and good books keep me company at the local coffee shop on lazy Sunday afternoons.

Among my many ambitions, I wish I could write like David Foster Wallace, think like a Philosopher, play the piano like Bill Evans, the guitar like Joe Pass, and cook authentic Sichuan cuisine.

This blog journals the thoughts of a restless mind.
