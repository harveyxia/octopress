Beneath Las Vegas are miles of tunnels leading out of the city in all directions. Made of cement and wide enough for cars, they are known as the *flood channels*. In the unlikely event of heavy rain, the city, being in a valley, would be flooded. The flood channels do exactly what their name suggests: they channel water from the city to the surrounding desert.

A few years ago Jason discovered an entrance to the channels by the desert next to his house. From a distance, it looked insignificantâ€”cement walls surrounded by wire fences. It looked like just another municipal structure, for the sewage system maybe. Walking up to it, I saw that the walls outlined a section dug out of the hill. On the wall facing into the hill (and into Vegas proper) was a square tunnel, as wide and tall as a single lane road. Jason handed me a flashlight and we headed in.

After a few minutes of walking, I glanced over my shoulder. A wall of pitch blackness met my eyes. Switching off the flashlight left us in total darkness. We were somewhere near the middle of this mile long tunnel.

The floor was littered with trash: bottles, newspapers, plastic bags, ragged clothing, anything that the rain had carried with it. Occasionally we saw signs of previous inhabitants. Dark smoke stains rising to a point on the walls. Dirty mattresses. Bicycles hung up to avoid being washed away. Part of me wondered if that lump in the mattress was a person. I wondered if we would encounter anyone in such a dark and isolated place.

I could hear nothing but the sound of our own footsteps and breathing. Occasionally, a car would run over a manhole cover, causing a sudden, jarring clunk to echo throughout the tunnel. I quickened my pace, waiting to see the distant glint of the other end.
