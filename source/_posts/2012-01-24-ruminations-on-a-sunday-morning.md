I know the passive impulse of your words,  
feeling righteous like a skyscraper  
grounded in unturned soil, yet nothing  
strives to the sky,  
touches the clouds,  
pierces the veil.

I know the sad submission of your being,  
less disappointing for me than wretched for you.

Nature’s spirit sprints and leaps and flies  
in short it moves.  
Human’s spirit is that and a soul for  
struggle  
For dreaming of moving towards  
impossible dimensions  
Not only scraping skies but forging heavens  
blazing with the  
intense will  
that is  
life.
