I'm an undergraduate at Yale University (SM ’16) majoring in Philosophy and Computer Science. My main interests in philosophy include ethics, free will, and the metaphysics of consciousness. I am a jazz musician who gigs around campus with a jazz quartet. I spend my spare time learning programming and web development.

When I’m not locked up in my room doing school work or wasting inordinate amounts of time on Reddit, I like going for walks in parks and woods; the more trees and the less noise the better. Dark coffees and good books keep me company at the local coffee shop on lazy Sunday afternoons.

Among my many ambitions, I wish I could write like David Foster Wallace, think like a Philosopher, play the piano like Bill Evans, the guitar like Joe Pass, and cook authentic Sichuan cuisine.
